# HTML-Template-for-Github-Pages

This is an updated HTML version of Jekyll page theme (Architect).
Good for a Portfolio.
Easy to use for code documentation.

#Why should you use this?
Because it is a little bit hard for someone to understand Jekyll system directly rather than to understand HTML and CSS.
